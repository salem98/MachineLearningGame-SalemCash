## The innovation
The idea came up with the mosquito terminator game on pysource.com üòâ
## Introduction 
This is the Computer Vision Game developed by myself. </br>
The game consists of zombies and angels flying in the center of the screen. Every time you swat a zombie you get 1 point and every time you swat an angel you lose 1 point. In case you swat multiple zombies, you will get multiple points; the same applies to swatting angels. Everything must be done within a certain number of seconds. This is the image of the Game.'

</br>
The game integrated tracking of the movements of the body with OpenCV. For the tracking of the hand gesture, which will be the joypad of our game, I used MediaPipe.
MediaPipe is a library deveploped by google ready to use and for multiple functions, for my project, just a few commands are enough and we manage to have 21 points of the hand. If you want more details on hand tracking I suggest you read the official [MediaPipe Hands guide](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)

## How to run the game
Clone the project and install all the needed packages, to run the game following command line:
<br>
    ```
    $ python main.py
    ```
## Future work
Depend on your purpose and idea, the game can be developed some features in the future, there are some of my recommendations üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
1. **Two players at one time**
2. **Create more levels with correspond screen**
3. **Set a target score for each level if the player could not reach the score the game have to reset to the first level**
4. ...etc...
## Summury
Hope you have a wonderfull time with my project, enjoy it and don't forget to follow and drop me a starüåü on my repo in github üòä
